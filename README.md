This is an end-to-end implementation of a deep feedforward neural network framework. The API is very similar to the Keras API. The framework itself is designed to have clean object-oriented abstractions that make semantic sense. It should be easy to read and use. Tests and documentation haven't been added yet, since this is a toy project. There are a bunch of sanity-check tests. The repository will hopefully evolve to be more powerful, more well-documented and more well-tested in the time to come.

Framework components are in the following folders:
	ActivationFunctions
	LossFunctions
	Neurons
	Layers
	NeuralNetwork
	Datasets
The following folders contain datasets and classifiers for those datasets:
	PlusDataset
The following folders have no purpose other than dumping temporary code:
	TempCodeDump

To test any particular component, go into the folder, run 'make' on the command-line and execute the executable that was generated by 'make'. Doing this within the 'PlusDataset' folder will train a network on the plus dataset and display results of training and testing,

example:
	cd PlusDataset
	make
	./Classifier
